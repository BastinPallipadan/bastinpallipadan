    <h2>Fold Mountains</h2>
    <div class="content-container">
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>Fold mountains are formed when two plates of the Earth's crust collide. This leads to crustal shortening along the thrust faults and the crust is over thickened. The fold mountains are mainly formed by the effects of folding on layers within the upper part of the Earth's crust. The movement responsible for the formation of the folds is known as orogenic movements.</p>
            <p>Orogenic movements refer to the mountain-building forces involving the forces of compression and tension. Folding is an outcome of the forces of compression when two horizontal forces act towards a common center from opposite directions. Examples of fold mountains are the Himalayas, Andes, and Alps.</p>

                <p>Block mountains, also known as fault-block mountains, are formed through tectonic processes involving the movement and fracturing of the Earth's crust. These mountains develop in regions where the crust is subjected to extensional forces, causing it to stretch and thin. This tension leads to the formation of faults, specifically normal faults, where the crust breaks and blocks of rock are displaced vertically.</p>
                <p>The blocks that are uplifted along these faults are called horsts, forming the elevated block mountains, while the blocks that subside are known as grabens, creating valleys or rift zones. Some examples are the Black Forest Mountain of Germany, Vosges Mountain of France, and Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa.</p>

            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Many plateaus are located in mountainous regions enclosed by mountains due to tectonic uplift (vertical uplift of the Earth's surface). This raises broad areas of flat land as a single unit. The largest plateaus on Earth were formed with the collision of two tectonic plates and were lifted far above sea level.</p>
                <p>These plateaus typically arise in areas of significant tectonic activity, such as at convergent plate boundaries where continental plates collide. An example is the Tibetan Plateau, between the Himalayas and Kunlun mountains, which is the largest and highest plateau.</p>

        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>A volcanic plateau is formed by numerous small volcanic eruptions that slowly build up over time, forming a plateau from the resulting lava flow. These plateaus are also known as plateaus of accumulation. For example, the Deccan Traps of the Deccan Plateau, the Columbia Plateau, and the Antrim plateau in Northern Ireland.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Alluvial plains are formed through the deposition of sediments carried by rivers and streams. These plains are typically created in lowland areas where a river exits a mountainous region onto a flatter landscape, causing a decrease in flow velocity. As a river's gradient flattens, its energy to transport sediment decreases, leading to sediment deposition across a wide area.</p>
                <p>A key feature in the formation of alluvial plains is the alluvial fan, which forms where a feeder channel (a main river channel that brings sediment from a higher elevation) spreads out and deposits sediments in a fan-shaped pattern at the base of a mountain range. Examples are the Indo-Gangetic Plain, formed by the depositional activities of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, and the Nile Delta.</p>
